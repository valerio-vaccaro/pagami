# Configuration

The complete configuration is based on regular JSON file written in the root
folder of your microSD.

You can find some examples at this [link](https://github.com/valerio-vaccaro/pagami/tree/master/sd).

## WIFI.TXT

This file is used to save information about the wifi connection.

```
{
    "ssid": "MyNet",
    "password": "MyPassword",
    "sound": true,
    "show_balance": true
}
```

## BTC.TXT

This file is used to store the list of addresses to check.

```
{
    "network": "testnet",
    "addresses": [
        "2N1pCrWruP2M95fN348zH6cVmspwsLoUZZR",
        "2NFgATehGMTRWsDb5tk8oW8Uc9zDK7vF2ou",
        "2MwMD7vzKgwxkiKbLp7XkTexvr6CopKHRpG",
        "2N1uxt8bxddDN38asChPQz4AQFmUagMGaDr",
        "2NDyuZBuW1ekuM4NErJMrw67GBuNge7vFWc",
        "2NBNj7fwWSGwkuN12mv3J4mqKALcUcpxepc",
        "2NEgQ7jNY93KcaAkFdb64TXGKRxYca2Vx4R",
        "2MwJmVTZwzf1h4wQ2vuGdDNMDtUZ8DzLf7x",
        "2MxfhLVhTesEmszK61Eyh4XLUwmmNqUN4An"
    ]
}
```

This file can not be very long due to the memory limitation of the board.

## Create BTC.TXT via a script

You can create the BTC.TXT file using utilities present in the [folder create_file](https://github.com/valerio-vaccaro/pagami/tree/master/sd/create_file).

The script `core_new_addr.py` allows you to create a file with new addresses generated by a core instance (via RPC).

The script `core_dump_wallet.py` allows you to parse a wallet dump generated by a core instance.
